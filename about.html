Avery has been around music since birth. He grew up performing and participating in his mother's church band.
As he aged, he began to take piano lessons and became a piano teacher. Within high school his compositions became
very abstract. He began to combine piano melodies with eccentric rhythm from his experience in drumline.
At the age of 22 he moved to Cincinnati to expand his musical pursuits. He work on all of the band's recordings and 
assists with organizing shows and events for his latest band, Hyde and the Escapees.
